I studied Telematics Engineering at the Instituto Politecnico Nacional in Mexico, I choose it because it’s a very wide and new field of study that joins two of the things that are changing the way we live.

It is an interdisciplinary field of study It focuses on Telecommunications and Informatic systems.

  

## Computer Science

  

It focuses on software engineering skills, including the theory, design and development. Some of the topics you learn as a Telematics Engineer are:

Imperative Programing, Data Structures, Algorithms, Object Oriented Programming, Systems Design, Information Theory, Data Bases, Embedded Systems, Multimedia, Networks, Distributed systems, Cryptography.

  

## Telecommunications

This field of study requires a very strong math background and as such about half of the career focuses on the electromagnetic theory required to understand how modern systems work.

  

Some of the systems that this filed of study covers are Cellular networks, fiber optics, Wireless transmission and electronics.

  

## Why I choose it?

I fell in love with computers since I was a kid, when I was in high school my perspective about them changed, I stated to make my own programs, to experiment and I loved to create things, I liked the programing language structure and what could be accomplished with it.

  

So, I knew I wanted to do computer science, but I wanted to do more, I wanted to have domain knowledge in some area, so that I could apply my programming skills to it and build great things!

  

That’s how I discovered Telematics Engineering offered the possibility to know more than computer science and I am glad I made that decision.
